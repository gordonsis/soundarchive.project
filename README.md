We made a website for the visually impaired. This site shares learning data for developing artificial intelligence that listens to sounds on behalf of the visually impaired.

## Motivation

Now days many services are developed that recognize people's words. for example we have Siri or Bixby in smartphones and also Alexa from Amazon and Google assistants. However, being able to sense non-human sounds is much more challenging.
Thus we sought to create a program that would help them by recognizing distinct sounds for them .artificial intelligence that we could teach to learn and differentiate between sounds. One of the problems we had was collecting sound samples, because there's a wide range of sounds and limited resources to high schoolers to solve this problem.
We decided to create a sound sampling of social networking system through the homepage. People can upload samples and label them. To give people motivation to participate, we created a point rating system using the blockchain technology and we gave points to those who unloaded sound samples or to those who commented on them. They will be able to use the point delivery sites that we have made contracts with.
when a sufficient amount of sound samples were collected, canō program can recognize sound to a certain extent can be helpful to people with hearing impairments in the future, in conjunction with smart phones or Arduino devices.
